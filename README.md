# HeliverseAssignment
Sir i do not have the greatest expertise while working with WebGl but i somehow managed to make that water effect but when i tried to use canvas to resize() the background it was not working properly and is just staying on page1 and not expanding.


i have not made the last section of the website as i wasted a lot of time figuring the water effect and i was travelling back from college to home on 17th,18th but all the properties that is required for that particular structure is already in use in the remaining website


the mismatch of color after the water effect was the second issue i was struggling with , as i couldnt figure out why i was not not able to override the parent properties so left it and made the rest 


if possible can you give some more days i will try to polish it as much as possible and complete the rest of it as well
Please do not consider incomplete website as straight up no,

Hoping for your Feedback,
Harmann Singh Bhomrah
